# chrome-downloader

## Usage

Download text from Wikipedia with one click. Useful for generating a corpus.

## Getting started

Clone the repository somewhere:

````
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/codekansas/chrome-downloader
````

Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`, check "Developer Mode" in the upper-right corner, click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the directory where the repository was cloned.

## Keyboard shortcut

Optionally, set a keyboard shortcut like `Ctrl-D` by going to the bottom of the page on `chrome://extensions/` selecting "Keyboard shortcuts" and configuring the shortcut for the page (this makes downloading much quicker).
